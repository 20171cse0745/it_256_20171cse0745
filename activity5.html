<p id="para1" style="color:red;">Justin Drew Bieber (born March 1, 1994 in Stratford, Ontario, Canada) is a Canadian pop singer and actor.He was discovered on YouTube in 2008. He grew up in Ontario. When he was twelve years old, he went into a local singing contest. He came in third place. The video of the contest was uploaded to his YouTube channel[4] run by his mother Pattie Mallette, where it was noticed by famous music industry manager Scott Samuel "Scooter" Braun. Braun's first time seeing Bieber was when he saw a video of the then 12-year-old boy on YouTube, singing a song by Ne-Yo. Braun contacted Bieber's mother, Mallette, who agreed to bring her son, now fourteen years old, to Atlanta to try working together. Braun convinced them to move from Canada to the United States. </p>

<p  id="para2" style="color:blue;">After more online marketing managing and success[5], Braun presented Bieber to two successful artists, Usher and Justin Timberlake; both showed interest. Eventually Usher's mentor, music executive L. A. Reid, signed Bieber to a deal with Island Def Jam.[6]
In 2009, Bieber toured with Iyaz and Taylor Swift, and traveled in the United States. His first album, My World, features four singles, "One Time", "One Less Lonely Girl", "Favorite Girl", and "Love Me". He signed to a record deal with Usher. He released My World 2.0 in March 2010 as his second album,[7] as well as going on a world tour. Purposes's single "Sorry" is Bieber's most popular song. </p>

<p  id="para3" style="color:yellow;">Bieber is a Christian.[9] Originally from Canada, he lives in the United States.[10]
On January 23, 2014, Justin was arrested in Miami, Florida, for drunk driving, resisting arrest and driving with an expired drivers license. Late 2013 and most of 2014 was a difficult time for Bieber because Scooter, Bieber's manager, was focused on his new client, Ariana Grande.
Bieber dated singer/songwriter Selena Gomez from 2011 to 2012, and on and off from 2013 to 2014. Even though he said in an interview in 2014 that he and Gomez were officially together once again, they broke up again.[11] Bieber got engaged to Hailey Baldwin on July 7, 2018. Baldwin is an American model.[12] They got married in 2018. </p>

<p  id="para4" style="color:green;">Born on March 1, 1994, in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, Justin Bieber was raised by a single mom in the small town of Stratford. Bieber, whose debut album, My World, hit stores in November 2009, is a true overnight success, having gone from an unknown, untrained singer whose mother posted YouTube clips of her boy performing, to a superstar with a big-time record deal, all in just two years.
Bieber always had an interest in music. His mother gave him a drum kit for his second birthday and, as he tells it, he was "basically banging on everything I could get my hands on." But it was a not well known talent contest in his hometown, in which the 12-year-old Bieber finished second, that put him on the road to superstardom. As a way to share his singing with family, Justin and his mom began posting clips of Bieber performing covers of Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Ne-Yo on YouTube. Within months, Bieber gained attention online, and an eager manager arranging for the teenager to fly to Atlanta to consider a record deal. There, Bieber had a chance meeting with Usher, who eventually signed the young singer to a contract. </p>
